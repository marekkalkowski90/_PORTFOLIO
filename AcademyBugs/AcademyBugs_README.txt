academybug.com is the website where are hiding 25 bugs that you should find. Just click on the suspect elements on that website and if you are clicking on right thing you will get a bug.
On that way you can learn how the bugs can look like and there's a lot of fun. Try to catch them all! :)

I'm still looking for the last one bug... :)
